## The `Board`

The `Board` will be a pentagonal shaped LED 2D board with each side having an approximately length of 4'. The LEDs will be multicolored and individually programmable. The board will change based on logic passed to it through the `brain`. 

### Technical Challenges

### Links & Notes 
* Number of LEDs will be based on the 'Centered Pentagonal number' 

### Execution Plan 
* First, we need to buy a rasberri pi or similar device along with a LED board and program it to some custom input based on an outside program. 
* Second, we need to build a custom built Pentagonal shape LED board that will serve as a scale model 
* Third, we need to build an actual size board and have it do custom animation
* Fourth, we need to combine the `board` with the `brain` and the `remote` to confirm it works perfectly. 
* Additional steps to follow
